# `next.jdbc` Options

This section documents all of the options that are supported by all of the functions in `next.jdbc`. Nearly every function accepts an optional hash map as the last argument, that can control many of the behaviors of the library.

The most general options are described first, followed by more specific options that apply only to certain functions.

## Datasources and Connections

Although `get-datasource` does not accept options, the "db spec" hash map passed in may contain the following options:

* `:dbtype` -- a string that identifies the type of JDBC database being used,
* `:dbname` -- a string that identifies the name of the actual database being used,
* `:dbname-separator` -- an optional string that can be used to override the `/` or `:` that is normally placed in front of the database name in the JDBC URL,
* `:host` -- an optional string that identifies the IP address or hostname of the server on which the database is running; the default is `"127.0.0.1"`; if `:none` is specified, `next.jdbc` will assume this is for a local database and will omit the host/port segment of the JDBC URL,
* `:host-prefix` -- an optional string that can be used to override the `//` that is normally placed in front of the IP address or hostname in the JDBC URL,
* `:port` -- an optional integer that identifies the port on which the database is running; for common database types, `next.jdbc` knows the default so this should only be needed for non-standard setups or "exotic" database types,
* `:classname` -- an optional string that identifies the name of the JDBC driver class to be used for the connection; for common database types, `next.jdbc` knows the default so this should only be needed for "exotic" database types,
* `:user` -- an optional string that identifies the database username to be used when authenticating,
* `:password` -- an optional string that identifies the database password to be used when authenticating.

Any additional keys provided in the "db spec" will be passed to the JDBC driver as `Properties` when each connection is made. Alternatively, when used with `next.jdbc.connection/->pool`, additional keys correspond to setters called on the pooled connection object.

If you are using HikariCP and `next.jdbc.connection/->pool` to create a connection pooled datasource, you need to provide `:username` for the database username (instead of, or as well as, `:user`).

Any path that calls `get-connection` will accept the following options:

* `:auto-commit` -- a `Boolean` that determines whether operations on this connection should be automatically committed (the default, `true`) or not; note that setting `:auto-commit false` is commonly required when you want to stream result set data from a query (along with fetch size etc -- see below),
* `:read-only` -- a `Boolean` that determines whether the operations on this connection should be read-only or not (the default, `false`).

If you need additional options set on a connection, you can either use Java interop to set them directly, or provide them as part of the "db spec" hash map passed to `get-datasource` (although then they will apply to _all_ connections obtained from that datasource).

## Generating SQL

The "friendly" SQL functions all accept the following options:

* `:table-fn` -- the quoting function to be used on the string that identifies the table name, if provided,
* `:column-fn` -- the quoting function to be used on any string that identifies a column name, if provided.

## Generating Rows and Result Sets

Any function that might realize a row or a result set will accept:

* `:builder-fn` -- a function that implements the `RowBuilder` and `ResultSetBuilder` protocols; strictly speaking, `plan` and `execute-one!` only need `RowBuilder` to be implemented (and `plan` only needs that if it actually has to realize a row) but most generation functions will implement both for ease of use.
* `:label-fn` -- if `:builder-fn` is specified as one of `next.jdbc.result-set`'s `as-modified-*` builders, this option must be present and should specify a string-to-string transformation that will be applied to the column label for each returned column name.
* `:qualifier-fn` -- if `:builder-fn` is specified as one of `next.jdbc.result-set`'s `as-modified-*` builders, this option should specify a string-to-string transformation that will be applied to the table name for each returned column name for which the table name is known. It can be omitted for the `as-unqualified-modified-*` variants.

## Prepared Statements

Any function that creates a `PreparedStatement` will accept the following options:

* `:concurrency` -- a keyword that specifies the concurrency level: `:read-only`, `:updatable`,
* `:cursors` -- a keyword that specifies whether cursors should be closed or held over a commit: `:close`, `:hold`,
* `:fetch-size` -- an integer that guides the JDBC driver in terms of how many rows to fetch at once; it is common to set `:fetch-size` to zero or a negative value in order to trigger streaming of result sets -- some JDBC drivers require additional options to be set on the connection _as well_,
* `:max-rows` -- an integer that tells the JDBC driver to limit result sets to this many rows,
* `:result-type` -- a keyword that affects how the `ResultSet` can be traversed: `:forward-only`, `:scroll-insensitive`, `:scroll-sensitive`,
* `:return-keys` -- a truthy value asks that the JDBC driver to return any generated keys created by the operation; it can be `true` or it can be a vector of keywords identifying column names that should be returned,
* `:timeout` -- an integer that specifies the timeout allowed for SQL operations.

If you specify either `:concurrency` or `:result-type`, you must specify _both_ of them. If you specify `:cursors`, you must also specify `:result-type` _and_ `:concurrency`.

*Note: For MS SQL Server to return table names (for qualified column names), you must specify `:result-type` with one of the scroll values (and so you must also specify `:concurrency`).*

Not all databases or drivers support all of these options, or all values for any given option. If `:return-keys` is a vector of column names and that is not supported, `next.jdbc` will attempt a generic "return generated keys" option instead. If that is not supported, `next.jdbc` will fall back to a regular SQL operation. If other options are not supported, you may get a `SQLException`.

In addition, `next.jdbc.prepare/execute-batch!` accepts an options hash map that can contain the following:

* `:batch-size` -- an integer that determines how to partition the parameter groups for submitting to the database in batches,
* `:large` -- a Boolean flag that indicates whether the batch will produce large update counts (`long` rather than `int` values).

## Transactions

The `transact` function and `with-transaction` macro accept the following options:

* `:isolation` -- a keyword that identifies the isolation to be used for this transaction: `:none`, `:read-committed`, `:read-uncommitted`, `:repeatedable-read`, or `:serializable`; these represent increasingly strict levels of transaction isolation and may not all be available depending on the database and/or JDBC driver being used,
* `:read-only` -- a `Boolean` that indicates whether the transaction should be read-only or not (the default),
* `:rollback-only` -- a `Boolean` that indicates whether the transaction should commit on success (the default) or rollback.

## Middleware

The `next.jdbc.middleware/wrapper` function (and the `post-processing-adapter`
in that namespace) accept the following options:

* `:pre-process-fn` -- a function that can pre-process the SQL & parameters vector and the options hash map before the SQL is executed; the default is to return both unchanged in a vector pair,
* `:post-process-fn` -- a function that can post-process the `ResultSet` object and the options hash map after the SQL is executed; the default is to return both unchanged in a vector pair,
* `:row!-fn` -- a function that can post-process each row as it is built (wrapping the call to `row!` within a result set builder); it is passed the row and the options and should return a (possibly updated) row; the default is to return the row unchanged,
* `:rs!-fn` -- a function that can post-process the result set once it is built (wrapping the call to `rs!` within a result set builder); it is passed the result set and the options and should return a (possibly updated) result set; the default is to return the result set unchanged.
